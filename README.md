# We're Baloney About Abalone

## Executive Summary

The UCI Abalone Dataset was used to develop a set of deliverables that demonstrate a range of data science skills. These include an exploratory data analysis, an R Shiny application that allows users to explore the relationship between age and other features, and an abalone-focused retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application.

To estimate abalone age using features that are easier to measure, several linear models were evaluated. The best-performing model employed Lasso regularization.

**Model Performance**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| MAE    | **1.35** |
| MAPE   | **12.74%** |
| RMSE   | **2.02** |
| R²     | **0.62** |

The RAG application uses methodology that is cutting edge in 2025. This repository includes a [notebook](https://github.com/Lone-Wolfgang/abalone-rag/blob/main/build_abalone_RAG_app.ipynb) that documents how the application was developed. We hope it will be useful for anyone that wants to learn more about RAG.
